# Experimental

This is an experimental client for offloading the tasks of redirection onto the client computer
reducing the number of servers that must be run and taking away the dependence of SSLv3 from the
server language

> Not planning on using this due to how large the executables emitted from this are
> would be nice if I could find a way to have this run as admin so that the host file
> redirects could be automatically added on open and close
